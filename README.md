# 🌧️ Cloudburst Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cloudburst events** using **Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques**.  
Cloudbursts are sudden and extreme rainfall events that can cause flash floods, landslides, and severe damage.  
Accurate prediction helps in **disaster management, early warnings, and risk reduction**.

Our system leverages historical **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric data** to train predictive models for identifying cloudburst-prone scenarios.
