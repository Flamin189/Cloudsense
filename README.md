# 🌧️ Cloudburst Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cloudburst events** using **Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques**.  
Cloudbursts are sudden and extreme rainfall events that can cause flash floods, landslides, and severe damage.  
Accurate prediction helps in **disaster management, early warnings, and risk reduction**.

Our system leverages historical **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric data** to train predictive models for identifying cloudburst-prone scenarios.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, normalization).  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- ✅ Machine Learning models for rainfall/cloudburst prediction.  
- ✅ Integration of **K-Means clustering** with ensemble models.  
- ✅ Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  
- ✅ Cloudburst alerts based on predictions.
